Recipes for vanilla items in The Long Dark. I try to keep them realistic.
There are a few "helper" blueprints like `StoneMultiplier.json`.
If you are looking for "god" blueprints, look elsewhere.

## Installation
* Download and install [ModComponentExtractor.exe](https://github.com/ds5678/ModComponentExtractor/releases/latest)
* Drag the `VanillaItemRecipes` folder to `ModComponentExtractor.exe`
* Move the resulting `VanillaItemRecipes.modcomponent` to your /mods folder
